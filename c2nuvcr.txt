c2nuvcr.pl - planets.nu interface
==================================

  This program imports planets.nu combat data into PCC2/PlayVCR for
  watching and simulation.



Requirements
-------------

  The program is written in Perl. You need a Perl interpreter. Since
  the planets.nu server sends compressed data, you also need the gzip
  program which c2nuvcr uses to decompress it.

  Type "perl --version" and "gzip --version" at a shell prompt to see
  whether you have these programs.

  Any Linux distribution should work. Under Windows, I have tried with
  Cygwin.

  You should also have PCC2 1.99.16, which has specific support for
  NuHost VCR (older versions will work, but may differ by a few
  percentage points in rare cases, see below.)



Step by Step
-------------

  (1) Create a directory to work in. For simplicity, drop the
      c2nuvcr.pl program in it (c2nuvcr.pl does not require that; if
      you know your way around shell prompts, you can adapt the
      following instructions to different locations). Open a shell
      prompt and navigate there.


  (2) Log in to planets.nu:

        perl c2nuvcr.pl login YOUR_USERNAME_HERE YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE

      This will talk to the server like your web browser would do,
      verify the password, and create a state file. It should say
      "++ Login succeeded ++" at the end.


  (3) List your games:

        perl c2nuvcr.pl list

      This step is optional, but useful to verify that c2nuvcr can
      actually talk to the web server.


  (4) Download the game you want to watch:

        perl c2nuvcr.pl --root="C:\Program Files\PCC2\specs" vcr GAME_NUMBER_HERE

      "C:\Program Files\PCC2" is the folder you have installed PlayVCR
      to. c2nuvcr.pl needs this folder to generate proper VGA Planets
      compatible files.

      This will create shiplist files and a VCR file.


  (5) Start PlayVCR, passing it the name of the VCR file as a
      parameter

        "C:\Program Files\PCC2\playvcr" vcr7.dat

      (alternatively, start PlayVCR normally, and use its file browser
      to navigate to the file.)

      PlayVCR 1.99.16 or newer will recognize the fight as having been
      hosted by NuHost. You can watch these battles like usual.

      The simulator can also be switched to NuHost mode (Ctrl+O, then
      option P).


  (6) c2nuvcr remembers the last parameters you used to access a game.
      When you download the next turn, you only need to specify the
      "vcr" verb, and can omit the other parameters:

        perl c2nuvcr.pl vcr


  There are a few more options; use 'perl c2nuvcr.pl --help' to see
  them.

  To save combat for later viewing, keep the "vcrX.dat" files.



How precise is it?
-------------------

  PlayVCR 1.99.16 emulates the VCR used by the browser client. This
  VCR implementation is close to the original Tim-VCR and is actually
  based upon PlayVCR's Tim-VCR implementation, but has occasional
  rounding differences (Tim-VCR: ERND, browser client: ROUND).

  Since there are known cases where the browser client and the host
  disagree in rounding in the very same way (e.g., taxation income
  seems to be computed using exact Tim-Host formulas using ERND, but
  the client uses ROUND), it remains to evaluate whether
  PlayVCR-trying-to-be-NuHost actually matches NuHost. Also, the exact
  balancing algorithm is unknown to me.
