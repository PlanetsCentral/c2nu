# c2nu
planets.nu to PCC2 adapter

This is a perl program to interface to the planets.nu VGAP host and produce
result files for use with [PCC2](http://phost.de/~stefan/pcc2.html)
(and other client programs, such as [VPA](http://vpa.sourceforge.net/)
or [PCC 1.x](http://phost.de/~stefan/pcc.html)).

It can download result files and upload turn files, allowing you to play
planets.nu on your local computer.
